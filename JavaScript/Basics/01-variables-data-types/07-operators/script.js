//1. aritmathic operators
let x;

x = 5 + 5;
x = 5 - 5;
x = 5 * 5;
x = 5 / 5;
x = 5 % 5;

//concatenation
x = "hello" + "world"

//exponent
x = 2 ** 3;

//increment
x = 1;
x++;

//decrement
x = 2;
x--;


//2. Assignment operators
x = 10;
x += 1;
x -= 2;
x *= 3;
x /= 2;
x %= 2;
x **=2;

//3. comparison operators
x = 2;

//equal value
x == 2;

//equal type and value
x===2;

//not equal value
x != 2;

//not equal value and type
x !== 2;

//greater than
x > 2;

//greater than or equal to
x >= 2;

//less than
x < 2;

//less than or equal to
x <= 2;
